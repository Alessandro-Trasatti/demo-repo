This is generally a markdown file that is presewnt in every repository.
Usually, this describes the code/porjects that are present in this repository.
As you can see, there are **plenty** of shortcuts that you can use. It should work the same as in any Jupyter notebook.
For instance you can type equations:
$$e^{i\pi} = -1$$
