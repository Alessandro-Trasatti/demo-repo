# Demo

This is generally a markdown file that is present in every repository.
Usually, this describes the code/projects that are present in this repository.
As you can see, there are **plenty** of shortcuts that you can use. It should work the same as in any Jupyter notebook.
For instance you can type equations:
$$e^{i\pi} = -1$$

First thing first, we pulled from the Github repository using the command <code>git clone</code>, copying the ssh. address. Now, I changed the fike locally. This can be checked using the command <code>git status</code>.
